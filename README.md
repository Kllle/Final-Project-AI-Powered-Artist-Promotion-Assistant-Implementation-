# 🔗 Live Demo (Vercel Deployment)

You can view the live Proof of Concept (POC) by clicking the file labeled Live Demo

This deployed version demonstrates:
- Mock live platform monitoring
- AI opportunity scoring simulation
- Lead management approval and denial workflow
- Performance analytics with mock metrics

# 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Powered Artist Promotion Assistant is a simulated marketing intelligence platform designed to help artists and managers identify promotion opportunities using AI-driven analysis. The system monitors multiple platforms, evaluates engagement opportunities, assigns AI scores, and tracks performance analytics through a centralized dashboard.

This working Proof of Concept (POC) showcases:
- Platform monitoring simulation
- Lead scoring and approval workflow
- Performance analytics with mock data
- AI-powered ranking logic (simulated)

# 🚀 Key Features

- Live Monitoring Simulation
     - Simulates tracking across multiple digital platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and LinkedIn.

- AI Opportunity Scoring System
  Each lead receives a dynamically generated AI score based on:

  - Engagement level
  - Follower count
  - Content type
  - Platform type

- Approval and Denial Workflow so users can:
  - Approve leads for outreach
  - Dismiss irrelevant leads
  - Track decision history

- Performance Analytics Dashboard
Displays:
  - Weekly lead activity
  - Total approvals vs dismissals
  - Conversion performance (mock)
  - Growth trend indicators

- Mock Data Pools Includes:
  - Expanded mock lead database
  - Realistic artist engagement scenarios

# 🧠 AI Logic (Simulated)

The AI scoring system is based on weighted criteria:

- Engagement volume
- Follower count
- Platform influence
- Content relevance

Final scores range from 0 to 100 and are used to rank and prioritize promotional opportunities.

This logic is fully simulated for the purposes of the Proof of Concept.
